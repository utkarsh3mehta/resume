        <p>Get data from 700 servers in Azure cloud inside a closed network.</p>
        <strong>Problem statement:</strong>
        <p>
          We generally used Invoke-AzureRmVMCommand to connect to our cloud
          infrastructure servers and run scripts locally. But this wouldn't work
          if we tried to 'GET' any data from the servers locally.
        </p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <p>
          Created a small Flask application and hosted it, once on a web server
          and once on Azure web app. The application took the data from the GET
          URL and saved it to a CSV file. Then, using the above-mentioned
          cmdlet, a script ran locally that collects the data and invokes a web
          request to the flask web app. All information was received within 2
          hours.
        </p>
        <strong>How things would have happened without the solution? </strong>
        <p>
          Resources would have been dedicated to this task and trained as it
          required some knowledge on Registry Entry. Since the server count was
          high, it would have taken at least 3 days to completely get the
          information. And not to ignore, human error, such as wrong or missing
          information.

        <strong>Problem statement:</strong>
        <p>
          Shift handover among team members is not effective enough. Handover is
          shared via mails and sometimes handovers stay for too long. Sometimes,
          no one knows who added the handover and people don't know what the
          latest update is.
        </p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <p>
          Created a Django based web application that allows you to create
          handovers easily. Add updates on the go and even attach documents to
          corresponding handovers. This way, the team could track and manage
          handovers seamlessly. They could also, know who created the handover
          and who knows most about the handover. And, see all activity logs on
          any handover.
        </p>
        <strong>Architecture:</strong>
        <p>
          The application is dockerized and uses docker-compose to communicate
          to its various components. The components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nginx web server</li>
          <li>G-Unicorn application server</li>
          <li>Postgres database</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Feedback:</strong>
        <p>
          The team was sceptical at first. But after good feedbacks and changes
          to the web application, the team was happy to use the application.
          Currently, handovers are shared via the web application itself.
          Handovers are getting solved faster and are getting lesser and lesser
          daily.

        <strong>Problem statement:</strong>
        <p>We get multiple tickets for password reset from multiple domains.</p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <p>
          Created a C# .NET web application that allows users to select the
          desired domain. Then it leads to that domain and allows password
          resetting and unlocking of account after a confirmation mail to your
          registered email ID.
        </p>
        <strong>Architecture:</strong>
        <p>
          A global application is hosted on Azure cloud as a PaaS component.
          While a separate local application is present on a web server, with AD
          roles, on all domains.
        </p>
        <strong>Effect:</strong>
        <p>
          The tickets for password reset dropped drastically and the team could
          invest their time on things more important.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-2" id="solution-4">#4</h3>
        <strong>Problem statement:</strong>
        <p>
          Send notifications to owners and clients before server and application
          patching every weekend.
        </p>
        <strong>Existing process:</strong>
        <p>
          The team creates tickets in SharePoint for 20 or more domains. The
          content of the ticket is then copied to a mail. This mail is then sent
          to each and every client or owners separately.
        </p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <p>
          Created a PowerShell script that injects a formatted recipient email
          CSV. The script simply asks the list of domains for which you would
          like to send the notification. And sends the mail in a desired format.
        </p>
        <strong>Effect:</strong>
        <p>
          The activity that took earlier minimum 1 hour and a dedicated resource
          now only requires 10 mins of validating the CSV file and selecting the
          domains, which can be done even by a naïve resource.
