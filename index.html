        <h3 class="mt-2">Solution 1:</h3>
        <strong>Task:</strong>
        <p>Get data from 700 servers in Azure cloud inside a closed network.</p>
        <strong>Problem statement:</strong>
        <p>
          We generally use Invoke-AzureRmVMCommand to connect to our cloud
          infrastructure servers and run scripts locally. But this wouldn&quot;t
          work if we tried to &quot;GET&quot; any data from the servers locally.
        </p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <p>
          I created a small Flask application and hosted it, once on a web
          server and once on Azure web app. The application simply takes the
          data from the GET URL and saves it to a CSV file. Then, using the
          above-mentioned cmdlet, I ran a script locally that collects the data
          and invokes a web request to my web API. This way I got data from our
          entire environment in just a matter of hours.
        </p>
        <strong>How things would have happened without the solution? </strong>
        <p>
          Resources would have been dedicated to this task and trained as it
          required some knowledge on Registry Entry. Also, because the server
          count is high, it would have taken at least 3 days to completely get
          the information. And not to ignore, human error, such as wrong or
          missing information.
